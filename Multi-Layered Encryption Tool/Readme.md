-   **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal usability across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
-   **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy encrypted or decrypted messages with a single click.
-   **Case Preservation:** Maintains the original casing of letters during the encryption and decryption processes.
-   **Special Character Support:** Handles a wide range of characters, including letters, numbers, spaces, and special symbols without errors.

----------

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** Structures the web application's content and layout.
-   **CSS3:** Styles the application with a modern and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript:** Implements the core encryption and decryption logic, handling user interactions and data processing.

----------

## How It Works

The encryption and decryption processes are built upon a combination of classical cryptographic techniques, each adding a layer of complexity to ensure message security.

### Encryption Process

1.  **Vigen√®re Cipher (Polyalphabetic Substitution)**
2.  **Columnar Transposition Cipher (Transposition)**
3.  **Reverse Text (Obfuscation)**

#### 1. Vigen√®re Cipher

**Purpose:** Adds a polyalphabetic substitution layer based on a keyword, making frequency analysis attacks more difficult.

**How It Works:**

-   **Keyword-Based Shifting:** Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a number of positions determined by the corresponding letter in the keyword.
-   **Case Preservation:** Maintains the original casing (uppercase or lowercase) of each letter.
-   **Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Characters outside the A-Z range (e.g., numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.

**Example:**

-   **Plaintext:** `HELLO WORLD`
-   **Keyword:** `SECRET`
-   **Encrypted Text:** `ZICVTWQNGRZG0PSO`

#### 2. Columnar Transposition Cipher

**Purpose:** Rearranges the characters of the message based on the order derived from the keyword, adding a transposition layer that obscures the message structure.

**How It Works:**

-   **Matrix Formation:** The encrypted text from the Vigen√®re Cipher is written into a matrix with columns equal to the length of the keyword.
-   **Column Ordering:** Columns are reordered based on the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword.
-   **Padding:** If the final row of the matrix isn't complete, a padding character (`'_'`) is added to fill the empty cells.
-   **Ciphertext Generation:** The ciphertext is generated by reading the characters column by column in the sorted order.

**Example:**

-   **Keyword:** `SECRET`
    
-   **Encrypted Text from Vigen√®re:** `ZICVTWQNGRZG0PSO`
    
-   **Matrix with Padding:**
    
    ```
    S  E  C  R  E  T
    Z  I  C  V  T  W
    Q  N  G  R  _  P
    S  O  _  _  _  _
    
    ```
    
-   **Ciphertext:** `ZQSGINVGRT_WP`
    

#### 3. Reverse Text

**Purpose:** Adds an additional layer of obfuscation by reversing the entire ciphertext, making pattern recognition even more challenging.

**How It Works:**

-   **Text Reversal:** The ciphertext from the Columnar Transposition Cipher is reversed character by character.

**Example:**

-   **Ciphertext Before Reversal:** `ZQSGINVGRT_WP`
-   **Final Encrypted Message:** `PW_RTGVNGISQZ`

### Decryption Process

The decryption process reverses the encryption steps to retrieve the original plaintext.

1.  **Reverse Text (Obfuscation)**
2.  **Columnar Transposition Cipher (Transposition)**
3.  **Vigen√®re Cipher (Polyalphabetic Substitution)**

#### 1. Reverse Text

**Purpose:** Removes the obfuscation layer added during encryption by reversing the ciphertext back to its original transposed form.

**How It Works:**

-   **Text Reversal:** The encrypted message is reversed character by character to restore the Columnar Transposition Cipher's output.

**Example:**

-   **Encrypted Message:** `PW_RTGVNGISQZ`
-   **Reversed Text:** `ZQSGINVGRT_WP`

#### 2. Columnar Transposition Cipher

**Purpose:** Reconstructs the original encrypted text from the Vigen√®re Cipher by reversing the columnar rearrangement.

**How It Works:**

-   **Matrix Reconstruction:** Based on the keyword, the ciphertext is divided into segments corresponding to each column in the original matrix.
-   **Handling Padding:** Padding characters (`'_'`) are identified and ignored to accurately reconstruct the message.
-   **Plaintext Recovery:** Characters are read row by row from the reconstructed matrix to retrieve the Vigen√®re Cipher's output.

**Example:**

-   **Reversed Ciphertext:** `ZQSGINVGRT_WP`
    
-   **Reconstructed Matrix:**
    
    ```
    Z  I  C  V  T  W
    Q  N  G  R  _  P
    S  O  _  _  _  _
    
    ```
    
-   **Decrypted Text After Transposition:** `ZICVTWQNGRZG0PSO`
    

#### 3. Vigen√®re Cipher

**Purpose:** Retrieves the original plaintext by reversing the keyword-based shifting applied during encryption.

**How It Works:**

-   **Keyword-Based Shifting:** Each letter in the transposed ciphertext is shifted backward by the number of positions determined by the corresponding letter in the keyword.
-   **Case Preservation:** Maintains the original casing of each letter.
-   **Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Remain unchanged, ensuring the integrity of the message structure.

**Example:**

-   **Encrypted Text from Columnar Transposition:** `ZICVTWQNGRZG0PSO`
-   **Keyword:** `SECRET`
-   **Decrypted Plaintext:** `HELLO WORLD`

## Handling Special Characters

Initially, the encryption tool included a **Symbol Replacement** layer to substitute specific characters with symbols. However, this approach caused issues when dealing with messages containing special characters, leading to decryption errors and garbled text.

### **Resolution: Removing Symbol Replacement Layer**

To ensure seamless handling of all characters, including special symbols, the **Symbol Replacement** layer was removed from both encryption and decryption processes. This adjustment allows the tool to process and preserve a wide range of characters without interference.

### **Impact:**

-   **Enhanced Flexibility:** Users can now encrypt and decrypt messages containing letters, numbers, spaces, and various special symbols without encountering errors.
-   **Simplified Process:** Removing an additional encryption layer reduces complexity, making the tool more reliable and user-friendly.

----------

-   **User Experience:** Designed with usability in mind, ensuring that users can navigate and operate the tool effortlessly across all devices.

### **3. Case Preservation**

-   **Original Casing:** Maintains the original uppercase or lowercase format of each letter in the message, ensuring that the decrypted text matches the plaintext precisely.

### **4. Error Handling and Validation**

-   **Input Validation:** Alerts users if they attempt to encrypt or decrypt without providing both the message and the Vigen√®re keyword.
-   **User Feedback:** Provides clear notifications to guide users in case of missing inputs or actions.

----------

----------

## Security Considerations

While the **Multi-Layered Encryption Tool** employs multiple layers of encryption to enhance message security, it's essential to understand its limitations and best use cases:

### **1. Intended Use**

-   **Educational Purposes:** Designed primarily for learning and exploring classical encryption techniques.
-   **Personal Communication:** Suitable for casual and personal use where high-level security is not critical.

### **2. Limitations**

-   **Not for Sensitive Data:** The tool does not employ modern, cryptographically secure algorithms like AES or RSA. Therefore, it should **not** be used for encrypting sensitive or confidential information.
-   **Vulnerability to Cryptanalysis:** Classical ciphers, even when combined, are susceptible to various cryptanalytic attacks by determined adversaries.

### **3. Recommendations for Enhanced Security**

-   **Use Established Standards:** For secure communications, rely on well-vetted encryption standards and protocols that offer robust security guarantees.
-   **Regular Updates:** Keep the tool updated with the latest security practices and consider integrating more secure cipher methods if necessary.
-   **Secure Key Management:** Ensure that encryption keys (keywords) are kept confidential and are shared securely between communicating parties.
