# JavaScript_Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini to intermediate-level JavaScript projects that I built while learning and practicing JavaScript. These projects cover a wide range of topics and concepts, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced techniques like DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and APIs.

Each project folder contains the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to run the application, along with a brief description of the project's functionality and the JavaScript concepts covered.

2. **Project 2**: Pig_game

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, simply navigate to the project's directory and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Some projects may require additional setup or dependencies, which will be detailed in the project's README file.
